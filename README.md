# Portfolio-Website
I made this website to showcase all my projects in a more readable way. This website is now depreciated and has been replaced with a React [portfolio website](https://github.com/Sean-Grobicki/Projects-Website). I have decided to keep this repository public as a way to showcase I know how to use PHP, HTML and CSS to build a website.
