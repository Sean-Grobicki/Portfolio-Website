                <div class = "sectionCon">
                    <ul>
                        <li>C# programming skills developed whilst producing a Connect 4 game in which you compete against an AI player I developed or against another player. I elaborated on the more complex data structures used in this project such as trees and graphs and added them to the existing project as my skills developed.</li>
                        <li>Java programming skills have been developed during university especially in the advanced programming unit where we were tasked with creating a scheduler for an airport system. This unit also included programming an android app using a web service to retrieve nearby train station locations and map them to your location. I used polymorphism, encapsulation and other object orientated techniques in the process of developing these programs. </li>
                        <li>My teamwork and project development skills have been developed through multiple projects. One of these was to implement a relational database within a team. Also, during the professional development unit, we followed the Kanban methodology to implement a point of sales system as part of a group.</li>
                        <li>Web development skills used when making my personal portfolio which includes programming in PHP, JavaScript and MYSQL as well as using HTML and CSS for the structure and design.</li>
                        <li>Other programming languages covered include Python and C++. </li>
                        <li>General interests include playing video games, watching and playing football. While playing, I learned leadership and teamwork skills and became an accomplished goalkeeper, winning player of the year twice. </li>
