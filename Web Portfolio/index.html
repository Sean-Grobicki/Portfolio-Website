                <p>My name is Sean and I'm an 18 year old who lives in Burnage, Manchester. Hobbies that i enjoy include playing video games and playing or watching football. I really enjoy problem solving and is one of the main reasons I enjoy studying this course so much. The feeling you get when a problem is solved and looking back at a project thatâ€™s took weeks or months to develop and see the final product is very satisfying and spurs me on to develop my skills and study harder. My inspiration for studying this subject in the first place came when I was choosing my options in year 9 and when the subject was explained to our class it really peaked my interest and in the end convinced me to choose this subject. </p>
