                    <h3> Programming Languages Principles and Design </h3>
                    <p>During this unit so far, we have studied the different types of programming languages and paradigms. Languages studied include Python, C, C++, Haskell and Prolog to give us an idea of the different types of languages. We have also studied how different languages compilers and interpreters work as well.</p>
                    <h3> Project </h3>
                    <p>My project is to design a program which will automatically generate test programming questions for students learning to program which will be able to automatically generate feedback and the answer for the user. As of this moment I am yet to start the implementation and am working on the design and research needed.</p>
