                <h3> Overview</h3>
                <p>I studied for my GCSE's at The Barlow RC High School in Didsbury. The mandatory subjects that we had to take were Maths, English, Science and Religion. English was split up into literature and language and you had the choice between core & additional science or choosing to do triple science which was Biology, Chemistry and Physics which was what I chose. My 3 options subjects were Business Studies, Computer Science and History. Computer Science was chosen as when we had the talk on it and tried some examples it seemed interesting. History was chosen as I am really interested in History and enjoyed reading up on it in my own time anyway. Business Studies was chosen as we had limited option blocks and that was what I thought the best of my options. My favourite subjects during this time were History, Computer Science and Maths as I enjoyed the problem-solving elements of the last two and enjoyed what we were learning in History.</p>
