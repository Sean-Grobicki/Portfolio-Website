                <h3> Advanced Programming </h3>
                <p>In Advanced Programming we expanded from programming last year still using Java. One of our assignments was to create a <a href = "../Projects/java.html">scheduler</a> which is shown in the projects. Another assignment was to create an <a href = "../Projects/java.html"> android app </a> within a day which would map the locations of train stations. </p>
                <h3> Algorithms and Data Structures </h3>
                <p>Algorithms and Data Structures consisted of implementing different data structures and algorithms using C#. We implemented Graphs and Trees and methods which would manipulate these data structures. The final assignment was to create a desktop application which was a <a href = "../Projects/java.html">word processing application </a> which implemented the text in a tree structure to be able to give information about each word.</p>
                <h3> Computer Networks and Operating Systems </h3>
                <p>In this unit the first half consisted of learning how to configure the different components in a network such a routers, switches, and machines. The second half of this unit was studying operating systems learning how to do bash scripting in Linux and understanding the file systems.</p>
                <h3> Professional Development </h3>
                <p>This unitâ€™s main component was a group project where we had the brief of creating a <a href = "../Projects/java.html" > POS system which we did in C# which was compatible with a barcode scanner.</a> Another part of the unit was to attend extracurricular activities related to the computing industry which I mainly chose to attend talks on topics I was interested in such as researching the games industry.</p>
