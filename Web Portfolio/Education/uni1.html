                <h3> Computer Systems Fundamentals </h3>
                <p>For the first part of this unit it was split between learning logic circuits and the mathematics behind computing such as graphs and matrices. The in the second half of this unit we learnt about Assembly language making some simple programs using assembly.</p>
                <h3> Information Systems </h3>
                <p>During this unit we undertook a project that would implement a relational database using a case study. Through this we learnt normalisation, use case studies and ERDâ€™s which helped us to design the database and then used oracle to implement and SQL to query the system.</p>
                <h3> Introduction to Web Design and Development </h3>
                <p>The first half of this unit consisted of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to help us develop an interactive website with customised video controls. The second half of this unit we learnt how to use php to do data processing through websites.
                <h3> Programming </h3>
                <p>During this unit we learnt the fundamentals of programming mainly using Java. We first used the more graphical IDE processing to see the output better then moved to using Eclipse to learn object orientated programming in more detail.</p>
