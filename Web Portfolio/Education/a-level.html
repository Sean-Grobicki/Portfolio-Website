                <h3> Overview</h3>
                <p>I studied for my A-Level’s at Aquinas College Stockport for a period of 2 years. The A-Level’s I chose were History, Computer Science and Maths. This was due to them being my favourite subjects at high school. I had the option to choose a fourth subject but opted against this due to not having any passion for any other subjects.</p>
                <h3> Maths </h3>
                <p>During the first year we were preparing for AS level where we studied the core Units  C1 and C2 as well as Decision maths which was heavily based on topics I had covered in Computer Science. The Second year we had the core units of C3 and C4 as well as Mechanics which was interesting as I hadn’t studied this before. </p>
                <h3> Computer Science </h3>
                <p>During the first year we focused on procedural programming and covered many more theory based topics such as Graphs, the fetch execute cycle and assembly language. The second year we learnt object orientated programming as well as some functional programming. We also had to make an end of year project which was for me a <a href = "../Projects/allProjects.html"> Connect 4 Game</a>.</p>
                <h3> History </h3>
                <p>History was the modern history option in which the 3 main topic we covered was Tsarist and Communist Russia 1864-1964, The causes of the French Revolution 1689-1789 and Modern Britain 1952 – 2007. I found the most interesting of these was the Russia topic seeing how much a country changed in around 100 years. </p>
